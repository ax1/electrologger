- [ ] add a "normal_cumulative" or a sine-like distributionas type of sensor, this will be very useful in time-series real sensing, for instance, the gaussian does not fit well for a temp sensor daily chart (spikes at the end of periods), but the cumulative distribution works better for these cases (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution), otherwise, use a pure sine but state that periodic, not rand
- [ ] test: add a log load and display, to visualize anomalies
